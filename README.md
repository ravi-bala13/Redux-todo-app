Problem
Create a todo application
use redux to achieve the following
a user can add a task, it should have a title and a status ( default false )
delete and toggle the status of each task features should be present
it should have an edit button
on clicking edit, bring up a modal / popup and a user should be able to toggle the status (or you can move to another page and manage as well )
same way do for delete as well
use any UI library or custom CSS to bring up the modal
on success update the item
Note:

split into smaller components
use css modules / styled components
